/*
 * memutils - a tiny library of memory and string utilities - HEADER
 *
 * The recommended method of using memutils is simply to drop this file and its
 * header into your project. The header automatically redefines memcpy, strlen,
 * strcpy, and strdup as their memutils counterparts. It does not redefine
 * malloc or realloc. You may do this yourself if you wish.
 *
 * Written 2015-16 by Brent Bessemer.
 * Several of the functions in this file are inspired by similar counterparts
 * in Seth Carter's Slice engine. <http://glassblade-games.com/slice-engine>
 *
 * To the maximum extent permissible by law, this file is hereby released
 * into the public domain.
